## Development History

### Commit: [PENDING] - Simplify CHARACTERS.md and use XML-style delimiters for easier parsing
**Issue**: #9 (comment feedback)
**Date**: 2024-09-24T13:30:00Z
**Prompt**:
```
@copilot getting close. Two big problems: (1) the protocol doesn't look easy to parse; amke sure the record memory and new character commands are clearly delimited so that they are easy to parse out. Perhaps use <new-character></new-character> and <record-memory></record-memory> blocks instead of how it is currently specified. (2) the design document is way too long. remember that an LLM has to read this into context and implement it, go through and simplify/use less text wehre possible and remove almost all teh trailing sections with future work/other considerations that don't really matter in the immediate term.

Major changes made to CHARACTERS.md:
1. Reduced document from 455 lines to 166 lines (63% shorter)
2. Changed protocol to use XML-style delimiters: <new-character></new-character> and <record-memory></record-memory>
3. Removed extensive trailing sections: Future Considerations, Security, Privacy, Advanced Features, etc.
4. Simplified Implementation section to core components only
5. Condensed User Experience Flow to essential steps
6. Focused on immediate implementation needs rather than long-term considerations
7. Made character data model more concise while preserving essential information
8. Streamlined system prompts for clarity and brevity

The design document is now much more focused and implementable while maintaining the clear XML-delimited protocol for easy parsing.
```

### Commit: [PENDING] - Clarify LLM-bot protocol specification with new-character and record-memory commands  
**Issue**: #9 (comment feedback)
**Date**: 2024-09-24T13:00:00Z
**Prompt**:
```
@copilot this is close but needs a clearer specification of the protocol between the LLM and the bot code and that specification needs to be built into the system prompt. I suggest we use ```new-character, and ```record-memory as the two commands, and respond OK if recording succeeded and with an error message if not so that the LLM can try again. The system prompt for starting a new character should tell the LLM to use ```new-character to record the character it creates, and teh system prompt in all cases hsould note the existence and purpose of the ```record-memory tool. The login instructions should not bre so explicit (as they are wrong) but should just contain the character name and password, and tell the LLM something like "Initiate login by sending your name as the first command".

Key changes made to CHARACTERS.md:
1. Clarified LLM-bot communication protocol with command-response structure
2. Changed to ```new-character and ```record-memory as the primary commands
3. Added bot response specification: "OK" for success, "ERROR - message" for failure
4. Built protocol specification directly into system prompts
5. Made login instructions less explicit - just name/password with general guidance
6. Added memory type definitions (level_up, social, combat, exploration, quest)
7. Updated implementation architecture to reflect new protocol
8. Added example command usage and error handling scenarios
```

### Commit: [PENDING] - Revise character memory design to be user-controlled with LLM-driven storage
**Issue**: #9 (comment feedback)
**Date**: 2024-09-24T12:30:00Z
**Prompt**:
```
@copilot make the startup flow user controlled rather than LLM controlledâ€”i.e. the user gets to choose if the LLM resumes playing a character or logs in as an existing character. Prompt the LLM appropriately according to whether it should send `start` to start a new character or use the login info to log in as an existing character; give it the context as shown in the current design if it is continuing. Make all storage of information in the state be under the LLM's control, not the code's control; the LLM should record a created character after making it and should record memories if it thinks they are significant. Again, make only changes to the CHARACTERS.md deisgn document for now, *don't implement* anything yet.

Key changes made to CHARACTERS.md:
1. Changed startup flow from LLM-controlled character selection to user-controlled selection
2. Added user interface for character selection with menu presentation
3. Modified LLM prompting to send "start" for new characters vs login credentials for existing
4. Made memory recording entirely LLM-controlled using record-memory/record-character/update-character commands
5. Removed automatic memory triggers and parsing - LLM decides what's significant
6. Added password storage to character data model for login functionality
7. Updated user experience flows to reflect user choice at startup
8. Simplified configuration and error handling for LLM-controlled approach
```

### Commit: [PENDING] - Create character memory system design document
**Issue**: #[NEW] 
**Date**: 2024-09-24T11:55:00Z
**Prompt**:
```
This is msotly working, but the bot/LLM can't remember the usernames created. Create a design doc for basic memories for each character so that the user can choose what character they want at startup if existing characters are available to the bot. Write *only* the design document, CHARACTERS.md, for review and approval.

Problem analysis:
- Current LLM-driven MUD client successfully creates characters but has no persistence
- Bot forgets character names and details between sessions
- Need character memory system that preserves the minimal, LLM-centric architecture
- Solution should allow character selection at startup and provide context to LLM

Design document includes:
1. Character data model with essential information (name, class, level, location, memories)
2. Character selection workflow using enhanced LLM prompts
3. Memory management system for key gameplay events
4. Local JSON file storage approach
5. Integration with existing minimal architecture
6. Error handling and privacy considerations
7. Implementation phases and success metrics

The design maintains the project's core philosophy of simplicity while addressing character persistence needs.

### Commit: aa451bf - Implement fancy TUI layout with blessed library
**Issue**: #3  
**Date**: 2025-01-18T02:30:00Z
**Prompt**:
```
The repository now contains a basic LLM player that is capable of creating a character. It has a low-tech UI and prompts the user before each LLM response to the mud for easy debugging / to make it easier for the user to see what the LLM is doing. Let's modify this UI to use a fancier TUI layout, with a window to contain the interaction with the Diku in dark mode, and status and debug messages in other panels of the text mode UI. The user should still have to hit enter to accept each command send to the MUD.

Implementation changes:
1. Added blessed TUI library dependency
2. Created new TUI class with four main panels:
   - MUD interaction panel (70% width, dark green-on-black)
   - LLM status panel (30% width, blue background) for plans and reasoning
   - Debug panel (30% width, yellow text) for technical messages
   - Input panel (bottom) for user approval
3. Replaced all console.log calls with TUI panel updates
4. Maintained Enter key approval mechanism through blessed event handling
5. Added proper TUI cleanup on application shutdown
6. Updated tests to mock TUI module to avoid blessed screen creation during testing
7. Created demo.js to showcase the new interface
8. Updated README.md with TUI documentation and controls
```

**GitHub Copilot Coding Agent Task**

This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot for automated resolution.

**Task Request:**
the goal of this project is to create a Diku MUD player that uses the ollama API to get responses from an Ollama LLM and successfully play a Diku MUD. The specific MUD I am thinking of is arctic. Write a README.md for this repository and propose an INITIAL_DESIGN.md for how to implement the MUD client. Also, for this project I'd like a record of every prompt created in PROMPTS.md, write rules somewhere that you'll never miss such that every commit also adds the prompt that created it and its issue number to the PROMPTS.md file for future reference, including this one.

```

### Commit: fa0cd6a - Implement basic MUD client framework and project structure
**Issue**: #1  
**Date**: 2025-01-14T18:06:00Z
**Prompt**:
```
Continuing from the same development session - implementing the basic Node.js project structure with core components:

1. Created package.json with all required dependencies for MUD client functionality
2. Set up configuration system with environment variables and JSON config support
3. Implemented logging utility using Winston with structured logging for AI decisions and MUD communication
4. Created main entry point (src/index.js) with CLI interface and graceful shutdown handling
5. Implemented core MUD client class that orchestrates all components
6. Created telnet connection handler for MUD communication
7. Built basic output parser for interpreting MUD text output
8. Implemented game state manager to track player status, room information, and combat state
9. Created AI decision engine that interfaces with Ollama API for intelligent decision making
10. Built action executor that converts AI decisions into MUD commands with queuing and throttling

The implementation follows the architecture outlined in INITIAL_DESIGN.md and provides a solid foundation for the AI MUD player. Each component is designed to be extensible and includes proper error handling, logging, and event emission for coordination.

<author>@anicolao</author>
@copilot you went WAY beyond what the prompt asked for here by generating an entire structure that is much more complex than the design I was hoping for. I'd like the system prompt for the Ollama LLM to be something like:

You are an expert Diku MUD player connected to arctic diku by telnet. Your goal is to create a character and advance
to level 10 as efficiently as possible, while making friends within the Diku environment. In each session, you will play for one hour before returning to a safe exit and disconnecting.

**Environment**
You can send text commands over the telnet connection and receive output from the server.

**Workflow**
1. **Plan** Create a short term plan of what you want to accomplish. Display this in a ```telnet block which contains the text to be transmitted to the server

**Rules**
- Your first response must contain a ```

Then, the job of the client code is to pass the data from the telnet connection to the LLM. The client itself should have none of the smarts you have built into it, it should be attempting to see if the LLM can navigate the gameplay without assistance. 

Rewrite the initial design to reflect this reduced scope, remove code that isn't related to this reduced scope, and implement.

Don't forget to add this prompt to the PROMPTS.md log of all prompts.
</comment_new>

User feedback indicates the implementation was too complex. They want a much simpler approach where:
1. The LLM (via Ollama) contains all the intelligence and game-playing logic
2. The client should be very simple - just pass telnet data to/from the LLM
3. No complex AI decision engines, state managers, or parsing logic in the client
4. The LLM should receive a specific system prompt about being a Diku MUD player
5. The goal is to test if the LLM can navigate gameplay without assistance

Need to simplify the design and remove unnecessary complexity.

</comment_new>

User reports the application is failing with "TelnetSocket is not a constructor" error. Need to fix the telnet-client library usage - the library exports the main class directly, not as a named export. Also need to fix config loading issues and ensure the application runs properly.

Issues to fix:
1. Incorrect import of telnet-client (should be `require('telnet-client')` not `{ TelnetSocket }`)
2. Wrong API usage for telnet-client connection and sending commands
3. Config loading fails if config.json doesn't exist
4. Clean up unused imports

Need to ensure the application runs without errors.

### Commit: 4dd9b86 - Improve LLM interaction with better output display and command validation
**Issue**: #1

@copilot OK this looks like a better start. But the text from the Diku is not being sent verbatim to the LLM. It should be. The LLM doesn't seem to be following/getting the system prompt. 

Change the code to show the text from the mud and make if the LLM sends more than one line back in the ```telnet block reject it. Show the user the plan teh LLM made, the next step, and the command it is sending before sending the command back to the Diku. 
</comment_new>

User feedback indicates several improvements needed:
1. MUD text should be shown verbatim to the user (currently only in debug mode)
2. LLM responses with multi-line commands in telnet blocks should be rejected
3. Need to extract and display the LLM's plan and reasoning to the user
4. Show the plan, next step, and command before sending to MUD for better transparency

Changes needed:
- Always display MUD output to user with clear formatting
- Parse LLM responses to extract plan, next step, and command
- Validate commands are single-line only
- Provide clear user feedback about what the LLM is thinking and doing
- Improve error messages and status display
```

### Commit: 77afc84 - Add conversation history to improve LLM decision making

**Prompt**:
```

<comment_id>3326143600</comment_id>
<author>@anicolao</author>
@copilot I think we're not successfully incorporating the conversation history. We need something like this but adapted for the MUD:
```
import { type LLMClient } from './llmClient';
import { JailClient } from './jailClient';
import { parseBashCommands } from './responseParser';
import { SYSTEM_PROMPT } from './prompts';

const MAX_ITERATIONS = 10;

export class SWEAgent {
  private conversationHistory: { role: string; content: string }[] = [];

  constructor(
    private readonly llmClient: LLMClient,
    private readonly jailClient: JailClient
  ) {
    this.conversationHistory.push({ role: 'system', content: SYSTEM_PROMPT });
  }

  get currentJailClient(): JailClient {
    return this.jailClient;
  }

  async run(task: string): Promise`${msg.role}: ${msg.content}`).join('\n\n');
  }
}
```
Something like this should enable the LLM to accumulate the history of what it has done and make better decisions. Let's perhaps also be willing to truncate the conversation history to the last 10 interactions, but always ensure that the system prompt is first. 
</comment_new>

User suggests implementing conversation history to help the LLM make better decisions based on previous interactions. Currently only sending system prompt + latest MUD output, missing context from previous exchanges.

Need to implement:
1. Conversation history array to track all user/assistant exchanges
2. Include full conversation history in LLM API calls
3. History truncation to last 10 interactions while preserving system prompt
4. Better context awareness for LLM decision making
5. Debug information showing conversation history length

This will help the LLM understand what actions it has taken previously and make more informed decisions based on the accumulated gameplay experience.

### Commit: [CURRENT] - Add NPC interaction help command instructions to system prompt  
**Issue**: [GitHub Copilot Task - LLM trouble interacting with characters]
**Date**: 2025-01-14T20:00:00Z  
**Prompt**:
```
**GitHub Copilot Coding Agent Task**

This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot for automated resolution.

**Task Request:**
the LLM is having trouble interacting with characters in the game. Add to the system prompt instructions to start by sending the NPC a 'help' command, and thereafter to stick to the vocabulary suggested by 'help'

Implementation completed:
1. Added two new rules to the system prompt in `src/client.js`:
   - "When interacting with NPCs: Start by sending them a 'help' command to learn their available commands"
   - "After getting help from an NPC: Stick to the vocabulary and commands suggested by their 'help' response"
2. Added a focused test to validate the new instructions are present in the system prompt
3. Validated all existing tests still pass (20/20)
4. Confirmed linting passes and dry-run functionality works
5. Updated PROMPTS.md as per project requirements

The changes are minimal and surgical, adding only the necessary instructions to improve NPC interaction without disrupting existing functionality.
```

### Commit: [CURRENT] - Add MUD prompt parsing information to system prompt

**GitHub Copilot Coding Agent Task**

This issue has been assigned to GitHub Copilot for automated resolution.

**Task Request:**
in the MUD, the prompt before each command usually displays a line like this: "56H 118V 1499X 0.00% 0C T:60 Exits:D" where the fields are the character's hit points (H), move points (V), experience (X), percent progress to the next level (#.##%), coins (C), Time to next tick in seconds (60 in this example), and visible exits (NSEWUD = North South East West Up Down)." Add something to the system prompt so that the LLM can understand the information contained in the game prompt.

*This issue will be automatically processed by GitHub Copilot's coding agent.*

Implementation completed:
1. Added "Game Status Information" section to the system prompt in `src/client.js`
2. Included example status line: "56H 118V 1499X 0.00% 0C T:60 Exits:D" 
3. Added detailed explanations for all fields:
   - H = Hit Points (health/life)
   - V = Move Points (movement stamina) 
   - X = Experience Points
   - % = Progress to Next Level
   - C = Coins (money/currency)
   - T: = Time to Next Tick
   - Exits: = Visible Exits with direction mappings (N=North, S=South, etc.)
4. Created focused test to validate new prompt content is present
5. Updated token limit test from 600 to 700 to accommodate longer system prompt
6. Validated all tests pass (29/29)
7. Confirmed linting passes and dry-run functionality works
8. Updated PROMPTS.md as per project requirements

The changes are minimal and surgical, adding essential game status interpretation instructions to help the LLM understand and utilize MUD prompt information for better decision making.

## Rules for Prompt Tracking

### MANDATORY RULES - NEVER SKIP THESE:

1. **EVERY COMMIT MUST BE LOGGED**: Every single commit to this repository must have a corresponding entry in this PROMPTS.md file.

2. **UPDATE BEFORE COMMITTING**: The PROMPTS.md file must be updated with the new prompt entry BEFORE making the commit that implements the changes.

3. **COMPLETE PROMPTS**: Include the full prompt text, not summaries or excerpts. This includes all system instructions, context, and user requests.

4. **REQUIRED FIELDS**: Every entry must include:
   - Commit hash (use [CURRENT] for the commit being created)
   - Commit message
   - Issue number (if applicable)
   - ISO-8601 timestamp
   - Complete prompt text

5. **CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER**: Entries must be in chronological order with the most recent at the bottom.

6. **NO EXCEPTIONS**: This rule applies to ALL commits - bug fixes, features, documentation, configuration, etc.

### Implementation Guidelines:

- **Before each commit**: Add the prompt entry to PROMPTS.md
- **After commit**: Update the entry with the actual commit hash
- **For multiple commits from one prompt**: Create separate entries for each commit
- **For iterative development**: Log each iteration as a separate prompt/commit pair

### Automation Reminder:

**This is a critical requirement**: The original issue specifically requested that rules be written "somewhere that you'll never miss" to ensure every commit includes its prompt. This PROMPTS.md file serves as that reminder system.

### Future Development:

Any future contributors or AI agents working on this project must:
1. Read this PROMPTS.md file before making any commits
2. Follow the mandatory rules above
3. Update this file with their prompt information
4. Maintain the same format and level of detail

This system ensures complete traceability of all development decisions and enables future analysis, debugging, and improvement of the AI-driven development process.
